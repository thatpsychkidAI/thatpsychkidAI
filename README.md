# Hi there! I'm Sharon 

Welcome to my Github profile! I am a social and behavioral scientist with a passion for exploring the intersection between technology and human behavior. I am particularly interested in the ways in which Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning can be used to solve complex social problems and improve quality of life.

On this Github profile, you will find a collection of my recent projects, which range from data analysis and visualization to machine learning and natural language processing. I am constantly learning and experimenting with new tools and techniques, and I believe that the best way to learn is by doing. Therefore, all of my projects are designed to be hands-on and practical, with a focus on real-world applications.

If you are interested in data analysis, machine learning, natural language processing, or any other related topics, please feel free to explore my Github repositories. Each project is fully documented, with detailed explanations of the data, methods, and results. Additionally, all of my code is open-source, so you are free to use, modify, and share it as you see fit.

Thank you for visiting my Github profile, and I hope that you find something here that interests and inspires you. If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to reach out
